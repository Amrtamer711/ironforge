# Sales Proposals Platform - Product Overview

A comprehensive guide to understanding what the Sales Proposals Platform does and how it helps sales teams work more efficiently.

---

## What Is This Platform?

The Sales Proposals Platform is an AI-powered assistant that helps sales teams create professional proposals, generate realistic billboard mockups, and manage booking orders - all through simple conversations.

Instead of spending hours creating proposals in PowerPoint, calculating rates, and manually compositing images onto billboard photos, sales representatives can simply tell the AI what they need, and it does the work for them.

## Core Features

### 1. AI Chat Assistant

The heart of the platform is an intelligent chat assistant that understands natural language requests.

**What You Can Ask:**

- "Create a proposal for Client ABC for Dubai Marina location, 4 weeks starting February 1st"
- "How much does the JBR location cost for 8 weeks?"
- "Show me available locations in Business Bay"
- "Generate a mockup with this creative for DIFC Tower"

**How It Works:**

1. Type your request in plain English
2. The AI understands what you need
3. It gathers the necessary information
4. It creates the proposal, mockup, or provides the information
5. You receive professional documents ready to share with clients

**Example Conversation:**

> **You:** I need a proposal for Tech Solutions Ltd for the Sheikh Zayed Road LED for 6 weeks starting March 15th

> **AI:** I'll create that proposal for you. The Sheikh Zayed Road LED for 6 weeks at the current rate would be AED 180,000 plus VAT. Let me generate the proposal document...

> **AI:** Here's your proposal: [Download Proposal PDF]
> - Client: Tech Solutions Ltd
> - Location: Sheikh Zayed Road LED
> - Duration: 6 weeks (March 15 - April 25)
> - Net Rate: AED 180,000
> - VAT (5%): AED 9,000
> - Total: AED 189,000

## How the AI Works

### Natural Language Understanding

The AI understands requests in plain English. You don't need to use specific commands or formats.

**These all work:**
- "I need a proposal for ABC Corp"
- "Can you create a proposal for ABC Corp?"
- "Make me a proposal - client is ABC Corp"
- "Generate proposal, ABC Corp is the client"

### Context Awareness

The AI remembers your conversation:

> **You:** Create a proposal for Marina Tower, 4 weeks

> **AI:** [Creates proposal]

> **You:** Actually, make it 6 weeks instead

> **AI:** [Updates the proposal to 6 weeks]

> **You:** And add the JBR location too

> **AI:** [Adds JBR to create a combined proposal]

### Accuracy & Reliability

- Uses current rate cards from the database
- Calculates pricing based on actual formulas
- Validates dates against availability
- Double-checks calculations before presenting

### Cost Tracking

Every AI interaction has a small cost (for the AI processing). The platform tracks this:
- Cost per conversation
- Cost by user
- Cost by workflow type
- Daily/monthly totals

Administrators can monitor these costs to ensure efficient usage.
