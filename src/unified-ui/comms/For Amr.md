## Comment out whenever you have done any of the below points.

#Current Requirements

1. There is an edit option for the mockup templates, Do you have any endpoint where the frame details and config is available for a particular template?

#Future Requirements

1. Companies Endpoint with all company details and the methods  - I can see that in /dev/companies path - confirm if this is correct. 
2. User - multiple Profile set and list
3. User - multiple Permission set
4. Profile - Profile to permission-sets relation
5. Hide teams, sharing rules etc which we are not using for now.
6. While saving the template images, can you also save a thumbnail for the templates so that the templates can load faster. Something like xxxx_n_thumb.png. Just include it with the existing response, as Thumbnail. I can then load both.
