Create a model response
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
Creates a model response. Provide text or image inputs to generate text or JSON outputs. Have the model call your own custom code or use built-in tools like web search or file search to use your own data as input for the model's response.

Request body
background
boolean

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to run the model response in the background. Learn more.

conversation
string or object

Optional
Defaults to null
The conversation that this response belongs to. Items from this conversation are prepended to input_items for this response request. Input items and output items from this response are automatically added to this conversation after this response completes.


Show possible types
include
array

Optional
Specify additional output data to include in the model response. Currently supported values are:

web_search_call.action.sources: Include the sources of the web search tool call.
code_interpreter_call.outputs: Includes the outputs of python code execution in code interpreter tool call items.
computer_call_output.output.image_url: Include image urls from the computer call output.
file_search_call.results: Include the search results of the file search tool call.
message.input_image.image_url: Include image urls from the input message.
message.output_text.logprobs: Include logprobs with assistant messages.
reasoning.encrypted_content: Includes an encrypted version of reasoning tokens in reasoning item outputs. This enables reasoning items to be used in multi-turn conversations when using the Responses API statelessly (like when the store parameter is set to false, or when an organization is enrolled in the zero data retention program).
input
string or array

Optional
Text, image, or file inputs to the model, used to generate a response.

Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Image inputs
File inputs
Conversation state
Function calling

Show possible types
instructions
string

Optional
A system (or developer) message inserted into the model's context.

When using along with previous_response_id, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.

max_output_tokens
integer

Optional
An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

max_tool_calls
integer

Optional
The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response. This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per individual tool. Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

model
string

Optional
Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o3. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.

previous_response_id
string

Optional
The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about conversation state. Cannot be used in conjunction with conversation.

prompt
object

Optional
Reference to a prompt template and its variables. Learn more.


Show properties
prompt_cache_key
string

Optional
Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests to optimize your cache hit rates. Replaces the user field. Learn more.

prompt_cache_retention
string

Optional
The retention policy for the prompt cache. Set to 24h to enable extended prompt caching, which keeps cached prefixes active for longer, up to a maximum of 24 hours. Learn more.

reasoning
object

Optional
gpt-5 and o-series models only

Configuration options for reasoning models.


Hide properties
effort
string

Optional
Defaults to medium
Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values are none, minimal, low, medium, and high. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

gpt-5.1 defaults to none, which does not perform reasoning. The supported reasoning values for gpt-5.1 are none, low, medium, and high. Tool calls are supported for all reasoning values in gpt-5.1.
All models before gpt-5.1 default to medium reasoning effort, and do not support none.
The gpt-5-pro model defaults to (and only supports) high reasoning effort.
generate_summary
Deprecated
string

Optional
Deprecated: use summary instead.

A summary of the reasoning performed by the model. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the model's reasoning process. One of auto, concise, or detailed.

summary
string

Optional
A summary of the reasoning performed by the model. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the model's reasoning process. One of auto, concise, or detailed.

concise is only supported for computer-use-preview models.

safety_identifier
string

Optional
A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. We recommend hashing their username or email address, in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. Learn more.

service_tier
string

Optional
Defaults to auto
Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
If set to 'flex' or 'priority', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier.
When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
When the service_tier parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.

store
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to store the generated model response for later retrieval via API.

stream
boolean

Optional
Defaults to false
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section below for more information.

stream_options
object

Optional
Defaults to null
Options for streaming responses. Only set this when you set stream: true.


Show properties
temperature
number

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

text
object

Optional
Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Structured Outputs

Hide properties

The default format is { "type": "text" } with no additional options.

Not recommended for gpt-4o and newer models:

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using json_schema is preferred for models that support it.


Show possible types
verbosity
string

Optional
Defaults to medium
Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values will result in more concise responses, while higher values will result in more verbose responses. Currently supported values are low, medium, and high.

Web search
==========

Allow models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.

Web search allows models to access up-to-date information from the internet and provide answers with sourced citations. To enable this, use the web search tool in the Responses API or, in some cases, Chat Completions.

There are three main types of web search available with OpenAI models:

1.  Non‑reasoning web search: The non-reasoning model sends the user’s query to the web search tool, which returns the response based on top results. There’s no internal planning and the model simply passes along the search tool’s responses. This method is fast and ideal for quick lookups.
2.  Agentic search with reasoning models is an approach where the model actively manages the search process. It can perform web searches as part of its chain of thought, analyze results, and decide whether to keep searching. This flexibility makes agentic search well suited to complex workflows, but it also means searches take longer than quick lookups. For example, you can adjust GPT-5’s reasoning level to change both the depth and latency of the search.
3.  Deep research is a specialized, agent-driven method for in-depth, extended investigations by reasoning models. The model conducts web searches as part of its chain of thought, often tapping into hundreds of sources. Deep research can run for several minutes and is best used with background mode. These tasks typically use models like `o3-deep-research`, `o4-mini-deep-research`, or `gpt-5` with reasoning level set to `high`.

Using the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses), you can enable web search by configuring it in the `tools` array in an API request to generate content. Like any other tool, the model can choose to search the web or not based on the content of the input prompt.

Web search tool example

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    tools: [
        { type: "web_search" },
    ],
    input: "What was a positive news story from today?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-5",
        "tools": [{"type": "web_search"}],
        "input": "what was a positive news story from today?"
    }'
```

```csharp
using OpenAI.Responses;

string key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY")!;
OpenAIResponseClient client = new(model: "gpt-5", apiKey: key);

ResponseCreationOptions options = new();
options.Tools.Add(ResponseTool.CreateWebSearchTool());

OpenAIResponse response = (OpenAIResponse)client.CreateResponse([
    ResponseItem.CreateUserMessageItem([
        ResponseContentPart.CreateInputTextPart("What was a positive news story from today?"),
    ]),
], options);

Console.WriteLine(response.GetOutputText());
```

Output and citations
--------------------

Model responses that use the web search tool will include two parts:

*   A `web_search_call` output item with the ID of the search call, along with the action taken in `web_search_call.action`. The action is one of:
    *   `search`, which represents a web search. It will usually (but not always) includes the search `query` and `domains` which were searched. Search actions incur a tool call cost (see [pricing](/docs/pricing#built-in-tools)).
    *   `open_page`, which represents a page being opened. Supported in reasoning models.
    *   `find_in_page`, which represents searching within a page. Supported in reasoning models.
*   A `message` output item containing:
    *   The text result in `message.content[0].text`
    *   Annotations `message.content[0].annotations` for the cited URLs

By default, the model's response will include inline citations for URLs found in the web search results. In addition to this, the `url_citation` annotation object will contain the URL, title and location of the cited source.

When displaying web results or information contained in web results to end users, inline citations must be made clearly visible and clickable in your user interface.

```json
[
    {
        "type": "web_search_call",
        "id": "ws_67c9fa0502748190b7dd390736892e100be649c1a5ff9609",
        "status": "completed"
    },

        "content": [
            {
                "type": "output_text",
                "text": "On March 6, 2025, several news...",
                "annotations": [
                    {
                        "type": "url_citation",
                        "start_index": 2606,
                        "end_index": 2758,
                        "url": "https://...",
                        "title": "Title..."
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Domain filtering
----------------

Domain filtering in web search lets you limit results to a specific set of domains. With the `filters` parameter you can set an allow-list of up to 20 URLs. When formatting URLs, omit the HTTP or HTTPS prefix. For example, use [`openai.com`](http://openai.com) instead of [`https://openai.com/`](https://openai.com/). This approach also includes subdomains in the search. Note that domain filtering is only available in the Responses API with the `web_search` tool.

Sources
-------

To view all URLs retrieved during a web search, use the `sources` field. Unlike inline citations, which show only the most relevant references, sources returns the complete list of URLs the model consulted when forming its response. The number of sources is often greater than the number of citations. Real-time third-party feeds are also surfaced here and are labeled as `oai-sports`, `oai-weather`, or `oai-finance`. The sources field is available with both the `web_search` and `web_search_preview` tools.

)

print(response.output_text)
```

User location
-------------

To refine search results based on geography, you can specify an approximate user location using country, city, region, and/or timezone.

*   The `city` and `region` fields are free text strings, like `Minneapolis` and `Minnesota` respectively.
*   The `country` field is a two-letter [ISO country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1), like `US`.
*   The `timezone` field is an [IANA timezone](https://timeapi.io/documentation/iana-timezones) like `America/Chicago`.

Note that user location is not supported for deep research models using web search.

Customizing user location

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="o4-mini",
    tools=[{
        "type": "web_search",

Live internet access
--------------------

Control whether the web search tool fetches live content or uses only cached/indexed results in the Responses API.

*   Set `external_web_access: false` on the `web_search` tool to run in offline/cache‑only mode.
*   Default is `true` (live access) if you do not set it.
*   Preview variants (`web_search_preview`) ignore this parameter and behave as if `external_web_access` is `true`.

Control live internet access

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" -d '{
  "model": "gpt-5",
  "tools": [
    { "type": "web_search", "external_web_access": false }
  ],
  "tool_choice": "auto",
  "input": "Find the sunrise time in Paris today and cite the source."
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
model: "gpt-5",
tools: [
  { type: "web_search", external_web_access: false },
],
tool_choice: "auto",
input: "Find the sunrise time in Paris today and cite the source.",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
  model="gpt-5",
  tools=[{ "type": "web_search", "external_web_access": False }],
  tool_choice="auto",
  input="Find the sunrise time in Paris today and cite the source.",
)
print(resp.output_text)
```

API compatibility
-----------------

Web search is available in the Responses API as the generally available version of the tool, `web_search`, as well as the earlier tool version, `web_search_preview`. To use web search in the Chat Completions API, use the specialized web search models `gpt-5-search-api`, `gpt-4o-search-preview` and `gpt-4o-mini-search-preview`.

Limitations
-----------

*   Web search is currently not supported in [`gpt-5`](/docs/models/gpt-5) with `minimal` reasoning, and [`gpt-4.1-nano`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1-nano).
*   When used as a tool in the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses), web search has the same tiered rate limits as the models above.
*   Web search is limited to a context window size of 128000 (even with [`gpt-4.1`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1) and [`gpt-4.1-mini`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1-mini) models).
